## GRC Homework: Assessing Security Culture 

This week we learned about security culture and to promote it within their organizations. It’s important that employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyber attacks aim to exploit human weakness via methods like phishing. People are the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses. 

For this unit’s homework, you will analyze the following security concern: 

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work. Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones. Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has numerous security implications. In this weeeks assignment, you will research these security risks and develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

Using the Security Culture Framework, you will develop a plan to combat this concern. Below are the deliverables for this week's assignment.

### Deliverable 1: Measure and Set Goals 

Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

1. Based on the above scenario, what is the behavior that employees should engage in?  For example, if the issue was that employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, you would want people to download attachments from only trusted sources. 

1. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving accordingly? For example, if the issue was that employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, you can conduct a survey to see how often people have engaged in this behavior.

1. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? For example, if the issue was that employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, a goal would be to have less than 5% of employees engage in such behavior. 


### Deliverable 2: Involve the Right people 

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved? Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be. 

### Deliverable 3: Training Plan 

Training is often part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern. In one page, indicate the following:

* How frequently will you run training? What modality will it take? (i.e. In-person, online, a combination of both?)

* What topics will you cover in your training and why? This will be the bulk of the deliverable. 

* After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda. 

### Deliverable 4: Other Solutions

Training alone isn’t often the solution to a security concern. Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following: 

* What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical? 

* What goal does this control have? Is it preventative, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating? 

* What is one advantage of each solution? 

* What is one disadvantage of each solution?
