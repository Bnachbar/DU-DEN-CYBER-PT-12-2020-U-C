## Security 101 Homework: Security Reporting

Congratulations on completing the first week of your cybersecurity program!

Throughout the week, we looked at maps and visualizations to get a taste of the cyber threat landscape in real-time.  While threat maps are fun, they are generally considered by cybersecurity professionals as visual eye candy and not a definitive representation of the threat landscape. Instead, most security professionals turn to prominent **reports**, **blogs**, and **research papers** to stay up to date on the field.

In your first homework, you will read through four prominent security reports and answer questions in order to get a basic understanding of the market. These reports contain a lot of information and some of the language might feel esoteric. However, the goal of this assignment is for you to get exposure and learn how to navigate through these reports. 

This is a critical skill in the current market of cybersecurity, the remainder of today's lesson will have students looking into three prominent security reports in order to get a basic understanding of the market.

This assignment is report-heavy, but know that research and reporting are massively important to the work of a cybersecurity professional. 

In addition to the reports, there are two worksheets that you will fill out while reading through the papers. These should act as guidelines for what you should pay close attention to, and should assist you greatly in understanding the research.
